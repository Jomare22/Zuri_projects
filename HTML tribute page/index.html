            <h1>Edward Christopher Sheeran</h1>
            <p><h4>Many people may know the English Grammy-winning singer-songwriter, musician, actor and former rapper, Ed Sheeran, for his hit songs like 'Thinking Out Loud,' 'Photograph,' 'Shape of You' and 'Perfect'. 
            But very few know how he came to be which is also the reason why I admire him.</h4>
            His story enspires to never give up on your dreams. He started playing guitar and singing at a local church by the age of four.
            He was bullied at school for being bad at sports, having orange hair, for stuttering and wearing big, thick-framed glasses. 
            He had a surgery which went wrong and left him with a lazy eye and serious speech problems. At the age of ten, he cured his
            stuttering by rapping along to Eminem's 'Marshall Matters' LP. He had his first live gig at the age of eleven. He recorded CD's as a teenager 
            which he sold from his backpack. He moved to Londen at the age of fourteen and was homeless for two and a half years - sleeping outside Buckingham Palace - and not being able to afford food.
            Despite his rough circumstances and having to sleep on circle line trains between his performances, he didn't give up. Instead he tried even harder and captured the attention of Example who invited him on his tour.
            He moved to Los Angeles without a place to stay or any connections. It took several acts of sending his music to everyone to finally be brought on stage by a local radio host. It was there where he was spotted
            by Jamie Foxx's manager who introduced the two to each other. Jamie Foxx was so impressed by Ed and invited him to stay in his home and use his recording studio where he was able to produce his '+' album and things started going in his direction.</p>
