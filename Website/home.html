        <h2>Name</h2>
        <p>I was given the name Jomar√© Hildegard Abels at birth, but throughout my life, I have gone by many aliases (especially on the web) and a self-given nickname 'Jo' to avoid the frustration of repeating my name to strangers and teaching them how to pronounce it.</p>
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I was born in Paarl, Western Cape (RSA), but grew up in Kakamas, Northern Cape (RSA). In my teenage years, I've travelled between these two places. I had a hard time deciding what I wanted to do in life as I have many interests and found myself naturally good at a lot of things. I am of INTJ-A personality type. While growing into a young-adult, I've travelled well over my home country. I could never stay in one place for too long as I am always seeking adventure, meeting new people and learning about their cultures and traditions, and generally just getting to know Earth.</p>
        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I enjoy exploring: Whether it comes to food tastes, trying out new baking recipes, going to a place I haven't been before or simply learning something new, my mind contantly seeks to be stimulated and my spirit needs to be enriched. Apart from exploring, I enjoy taking walks, reading novels/comics, listening to music and watching anime.</p>
        <h2>Priorities</h2>
        <p>I am currently trying to get through the I4GxZuri web development training in order to increase my chances of getting a job as well as getting to know more about technology in general. I have also prioritised taking care of my mental and spiritual health.</p>
        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>I have a degree in Computer Information Systems and a TEFL certificate. Formally, I have the know-how to teach English, manage a business, lead a software development team, analyse software, and do some C# programming. I also know how to build, maintain and query a database management system. Informally, I know how to drive, sing, cook and bake, draw and design, do some wood-work and tiling, and speak some Japanese. </p>
